1. Legal Requirement: Mandatory Coverage
* Rule: Every resident in Switzerland must take out basic health insurance (Grundversicherung / LAMal / KVG) within three months of registering.
* Scope: This applies to everyone, including newborns. There are no employer-sponsored health plans; individuals must purchase their own policies.
* Source Authority: Health insurance requirement for persons resident in Switzerland (ch.ch).

2. Validity of Foreign Insurance
* General Rule: Foreign health insurance is generally not accepted as a substitute for Swiss mandatory insurance.
* Exception: EU/EFTA cross-border workers ("Grenzgänger") may be eligible to keep foreign coverage, provided they file a formal exemption.
* Source Authority: Health insurance for Cross-border commuters.

3. Basic vs. Supplementary Insurance
* Basic Insurance (Grundversicherung): Mandatory. Coverage is identical across all insurers by federal law. Includes general doctor visits, hospital stays in the canton of residence, maternity care, and emergencies.
* Supplementary Insurance (Zusatzversicherung): Optional. Covers "comfort" and non-essential services such as private hospital rooms, free choice of doctor, alternative medicine, dental, and vision.
* Recommendation: Supplementary insurance is cost-efficient for specific needs (e.g., gym memberships, maternity comfort) but is not required for legal compliance or essential health.

4. Determinants of Premium Costs
Premiums are not flat-rate; they vary based on:
1. Geography: Canton and Commune of residence (e.g., Zug is cheaper than Zurich).
2. Age: Different brackets for children, young adults, and adults.
3. Model: The chosen insurance model (Standard vs. Telmed/HMO).
* Note: For Basic Insurance, premiums are NOT affected by medical history.

5. Franchise (Deductible) Selection Strategy
Residents must choose a Franchise between CHF 300 and CHF 2,500.
* High Franchise (CHF 2,500): Results in lower monthly premiums. Best for healthy individuals who rarely visit doctors.
* Low Franchise (CHF 3,000): Results in higher monthly premiums. Best for children, people with chronic conditions, or those requiring frequent medical care.

6. Changing Insurers (Switching)
* Frequency: Residents can switch basic insurance providers once a year.
* Deadline: The cancellation letter must reach the current insurer by November 30.
* Effect Date: The new policy begins automatically on January 1.
* Process: The new insurer typically handles the transition after sign-up.

7. International Coverage (Travel)
* EU/EFTA: Swiss insurance covers emergency treatment via the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).
* Rest of World: Coverage is limited to emergencies only.
* Reimbursement Cap: Non-EU emergency costs are usually covered up to double the cost of the same treatment in Switzerland.
* Recommendation: For travel to high-cost countries (e.g., USA), travel insurance or supplementary global cover is recommended.

8. Family Coverage Structure
* Individual Policies: There are no "family bundles." Each family member (partner, children) has an individual policy.
* Optimization: Family members can have different insurers and models. (e.g., One partner on Telmed, the other on Standard; children on low deductible).

9. Cost Optimization Tactics
To reduce premiums while maintaining mandatory coverage:
1. Choose an Alternative Model: HMO or Telmed models are cheaper than the Standard model but require a referral or call before visiting a specialist.
2. Optimize Franchise: Choose CHF 2,500 if healthy.
3. Exclude Accident Coverage: If employed for more than 8 hours per week, the employer covers non-occupational accidents (NBU). The employee can drop accident coverage from their health insurance.
4. Annual Comparison: Prices change yearly; compare premiums annually on platforms like comparis.ch.

10. System Overview
The Swiss healthcare system is decentralized and market-driven. While it ensures universal coverage and high standards of care, it relies on competition between private insurers rather than a single state-run fund. This results in complex pricing structures that reward active management by the insured.
