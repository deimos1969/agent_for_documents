1. Executive Summary: The 4-Pillar Concept
The Swiss pension system is officially composed of three pillars, but a strategic approach requires a "Fourth Pillar" (Personal Independence).
* Pillar 1 (State): Solidarity-based, guarantees basic existence.
* Pillar 2 (Occupational): Capital-based, maintains standard of living (target ~60% of final income).
* Pillar 3 (Private): Voluntary, tax-advantaged (3a) or flexible (3b).
* Pillar 4 (Personal): Independent liquid assets (ETFs, savings) for resilience.

2. Pillar 1: AHV/AVS (State Pension)
* Function: Mandatory state pension based on solidarity. Current workers fund current retirees (Pay-as-you-go).
* Payout Structure (2025):
  - Minimum for singles: CHF 1,260 / month.
  - Maximum for singles: CHF 2,520 / month.
  - Maximum for married couples: CHF 3,780 / month (capped at 150% of the max single pension).
* Mechanism: Contributions do not go into a personal account but into a national pot. Payouts are adjusted periodically for inflation and wages.

3. Pillar 2: BVG/LPP (Occupational Pension)
* Function: Occupational pension funded by both employer and employee. Assets are capitalized (saved and invested) in the employee's name.
* Structure:
  - Mandatory Portion: Insures salary up to a specific ceiling (CHF 88,200). Protected by the Guarantee Fund.
  - Extra-Mandatory Portion: Insures salary above the ceiling. Rules vary by employer.
* Safety Net: The "Guarantee Fund" (Sicherheitsfonds BVG / Fonds de garantie LPP) protects the mandatory benefits if a pension fund becomes insolvent.
* Risks: Declining conversion rates (the rate at which capital is turned into a pension) and inflation may reduce future purchasing power.

4. Pillar 3: Voluntary Private Provision
* Pillar 3a (Restricted):
  - Tax Benefit: Contributions are tax-deductible from taxable income.
  - 2025 Limit (Employees): CHF 7,258 per year.
  - 2025 Limit (Self-employed without Pillar 2): 20% of income, max CHF 36,288.
  - Constraints: Funds are locked until retirement (or specific exceptions: home ownership, self-employment, leaving Switzerland).
  - Investment: Can be invested in funds/ETFs for compound growth.
* Pillar 3b (Unrestricted):
  - Tax Benefit: None (contributions are not deductible).
  - Constraints: None (fully liquid).
  - Use Case: Life insurance coverage or beneficiary designation outside of inheritance law. For pure wealth accumulation, a standard brokerage account is often superior due to lower fees.

5. Pillar 4: Personal Financial Independence
* Definition: Private savings and investments held outside the pension system (e.g., Brokerage accounts).
* Key Advantage: Liquidity. Funds are accessible at any age (e.g., for a career break or early retirement) without legal restrictions.
* Implementation Case Study:
  - Platform: DEGIRO (cited for low fees, no custody fees, CHF currency handling).
  - Strategy: Low-fee ETFs held for the long term.

6. Withdrawal Strategy
* The Tax Progression Trap: Lump-sum withdrawals are taxed progressively. Withdrawing a large sum in a single year results in a higher tax rate than withdrawing smaller sums over multiple years.
* Optimization Strategy:
  - Stagger withdrawals: If you have multiple Pillar 3a accounts, close them in different years.
  - Split Pillar 2: If possible, take part as a pension (taxed as income) and part as capital (taxed as lump sum) to manage tax brackets.
* Geography: Tax rates vary significantly by canton (e.g., Schwyz vs. Zurich).

7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Summary
* Buy-in vs. ETF:
  - Short Horizon (<5-10 years): Pillar 2 buy-ins are superior due to immediate tax deduction and lower volatility.
  - Long Horizon (>10-15 years): ETFs/Pillar 3a often outperform due to higher equity exposure and compounding.
* Ownership of Pillar 2: The capital belongs to the individual but is legally "locked" for retirement purposes. The mandatory portion is state-guaranteed.
* Pension (Annuity) vs. Lump Sum:
  - Pension: Lifetime income, no market risk, but no capital for heirs.
  - Lump Sum: Full control, capital can be bequeathed, but individual bears longevity and market risk.
  - Common Mistake: Waiting too long (age 50+) to review the pension statement, missing opportunities for tax-optimized buy-ins.
